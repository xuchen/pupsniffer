# local version or not. If "local" is set to yes, PupSniffer will crawl websites
# from the file system. In this case, "saveDir" is the top directory with
# all websites, while urlList is a list of sub-directory, indicating
# each website's domain name. The whole directory looks like:
#
# saveDir/
#    |---www.cas.gov.hk
#    |---www.epd.gov.hk
#    |---www....
#
# If "local" is set to no, PupSniffer will crawl a list of websites indicated by
# "urlList" and save it to "saveDir".

# just recursively list and read all files in the saveDir. If option has no effect
# when local=no
