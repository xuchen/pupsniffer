This is Pup(Parallel URL Pattern) Sniffer, An Efficient Multilingual Web Corpus Tool.

What is it
------------------

An implementation of the following paper (Kit and Ng 2007):
  • Chunyu Kit and Jessica Y. H. Ng. 2007. An intelligent Web agent
    to mine bilingual parallel pages via automatic discovery of URL
    pairing patterns. In 2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
    Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology -
    Workshops: Workshop on Agents and Data Mining Interaction
    (ADMI-07), pp.526-529. Silicon Valley, California, November 2-5,
    2007.

It discovers URL patterns of parallel webpages and download
them. For instance, it tells you the following two webpages
have the same content but different languages:
   • English:
      http://www.cas.gov.hk/eng/org/org_volunteer.html
   • Traditional Chinese:
      http://www.cas.gov.hk/chi/org/org_volunteer.html


Accuracy: It retrieves 98% true parallel webpages on 20 selected Hong
 Kong websites (Kit and Ng 2007).
