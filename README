This is Pup(Parallel URL Pattern) Sniffer, An Efficient Multilingual Web Corpus Tool.

What is it
------------------

An implementation of the following paper (Kit and Ng 2007):
  • Chunyu Kit and Jessica Y. H. Ng. 2007. An intelligent Web agent
    to mine bilingual parallel pages via automatic discovery of URL
    pairing patterns. In 2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
    Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology -
    Workshops: Workshop on Agents and Data Mining Interaction
    (ADMI-07), pp.526-529. Silicon Valley, California, November 2-5,
    2007.

It discovers URL patterns of parallel webpages and download
them. For instance, it tells you the following two webpages
have the same content but different languages:
   • English:
      http://www.cas.gov.hk/eng/org/org_volunteer.html
   • Traditional Chinese:
      http://www.cas.gov.hk/chi/org/org_volunteer.html


Accuracy: It retrieves 98% true parallel webpages on 20 selected Hong
 Kong websites (Kit and Ng 2007).



How to Run it
------------------

Modify config.txt accordingly. You must have Java 1.6 to run!

Under Linux/Mac:
    ./run.sh

Under Windows:
    run.cmd

Local Version Support
------------------

From version 1.2, PupSniffer supports crawling from file systems. This is due to
that the internal crawler used in PupSniffer is not a full-featured crawler. For
instance, it doesn't follow web pages generated by javascript or flash and the 
downloading speed isn't satisfactory. Thus external web crawling tools, such as
wget or Apach Nutch, are encouraged for using. When the crawling job is done, point
PupSniffer to the saving directory and it will read the local web pages and analyze
URL patterns. 

Build Instructions
------------------

You can do either:

1. Setup an Eclipse project with this package. Eclipse builds Pup Sniffer for you.
2. run "ant jar" if you have ant installed.
